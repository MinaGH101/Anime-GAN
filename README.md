# Anime-GAN
this is a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) to generate Anime Faces!
here I used a deep 5 layers Conv2D layers for both Generator and Discriminator,
the result is pretty good for 15 epochs, but it'll be much better if u use higher epochs and lower learning rates:)
* the code is in pytorch.
