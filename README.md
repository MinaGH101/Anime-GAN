# Anime-GAN
this is a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) to generate Anime Faces!
here I used a deep 5 layers Conv2D layers for Discriminator and a 5 layers ConvTranspos2D for Generator,
the result is pretty good for 15 epochs, but it'll be much better if u use higher epochs and lower learning rates!

Help yourself and run the code in colab, but first u need to upload the dataset .zip file on your Google Drive ;)
* the code is in pytorch.
